# Lab01
Welcome to your first Embedded Systems lab! In this lab you'll be introduced to the NodeMCU ESP-12E embedded processor, you'll write code to blink two on-board LEDs, and you'll run a program to determine your NodeMCU's MAC address. You'll also be using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom (all of which should be familiar to you from your Microprocessors class).

You have three turn-ins for this lab--the annotated lab handout (EECE4263Lab01.pdf) and two program files (Blink.ino and MAC.ino). All three will be submitted via your GitHub repo, as explained in the lab handout.

Have fun!
