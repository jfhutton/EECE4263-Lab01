# Lab01
Welcome to your first Embedded Systems lab! In this lab you'll be introduced to the Huzzah ESP32 Feather embedded processor board, you'll leverage the Arduino "blink" code and modify the timing.  Then you'll leverage a simple Arduino .ino sketch by copy/pasting the key instructions into your Blink.cpp file.  Using this, you will be able to read the MAC addresses for both of your ESP32 boards.  (We must "whitelist" them so we can use these boards in later labs on the Lipscomb network). You'll also be using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom (all of which should be familiar to you from your Microprocessors class).

You will have to answer the questions from the lab procedure, and push your final code back to GitHub Classroom.

Have fun!
